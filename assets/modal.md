## What this app can do

This application allows you to visualize and characterize cerebral vascular patterns of pediatric patients. The healthcare professional uploads a radiological image and applying the corresponding processing we achieve a classification of the image as symmetric or asymmetric. This information is useful and complements other tests that can help determine the final diagnosis of the patient.
